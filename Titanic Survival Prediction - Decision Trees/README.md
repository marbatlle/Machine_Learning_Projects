# Titanic Project

**Date:** Jan 13th 2021

**Description:** The Titanic challenge hosted on Kaggle is a competition where the goal is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat.

**Includes:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Validation(MAE), Classification Algorithms (Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier)

*Personal Note: This is my first data science project using python's package pandas to do the Exploratory Data Analysis and the package scikit-learn to apply the Machine Learning methods.*
